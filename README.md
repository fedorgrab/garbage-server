# Garbage Project: FastAPI Model Inference Server

This repo is a part of my Garbage Project. This code represents simple web server powered with guvicorn and FastAPI to deploy my ResNet50 Garbage Classification Model.
Both PyTorch and Tensorflow deplyment are implemented and being tested for accuracy, inference speed and training spped.
